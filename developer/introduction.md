# Developer documentation

FluxBB v2.0 still aims to be a fast, light-weight and user-friendly forum software, stripped down to the essential features every forum needs.
Under the hood, a lot of things have changed, though.
Gone is the old, procedural code that mixed control flow, database queries, and output (HTML etc.) in one file.
The new core is strictly object-oriented and strives to be well architected and extendable.

## Understanding the core

- [Actions](actions.md)
- [Routing](routing.md)
- [Controllers](controllers.md)
- [Validators](validators.md)

## Writing extensions

*Look forward to Alpha4!*

## Integrating FluxBB with other components

*Wait for the Beta!*
